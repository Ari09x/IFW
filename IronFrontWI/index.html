                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>The Wisconsin Iron Front is an unofficial localized branch of the American Iron Front, a non-partisan anti-fascist network spread across the United States and parts of Europe.

                <br><br>The Iron Front of Wisconsin uses various means at its disposal to counteract the presence and spread of fascism within the United States, including protesting, covering up fascist graffiti, posting flyers, and organizing community service efforts in order to better maintain and connect with the community.

                <br><br>By joining the Wisconsin Iron Front, you are choosing to leave behind any and all prejudices built on race, sexual orientation, religion, or political party affiliation in favor of becoming part of a single indivisible front standing against the looming threat of American fascism.

                <br><br>Both the Wisconsin Iron Front and the American Iron Front are entirely bipartisan organizations - meaning that it doesn't matter whether you're a Republican, Democrat, or something in between, as long as you recognize and are willing to help prevent the spread of tyranny within our nation.

                <br><br>Note that this organization will not permit or encourage the use of any form of violence unless in proven self-defense.</p>
